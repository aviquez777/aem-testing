For more than 75 years, the Canada-Mexico relationship has been characterized by the development of strong cultural connections, growing trade, and investment across a variety of sectors. Mexico is a priority market for Export Development Canada (EDC) given the abundant prospects for the Canadian companies we serve.&lt;br&gt;Since 2000, through its local representation offices in Monterrey and Mexico City, EDC has supported more than 10,000 Canadian companies and facilitated $40 billion in business in the Mexican market.

The country has a highly accommodating business environment, making it an attractive location for investment. Following Brexit, the Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement was signed and introduced in the House of Commons in December 2020. Canada and the U.K. have put in place temporary measures that ensure continued preferential tariff treatment for goods shipped between both countries until the agreement enters into force.&lt;br&gt;Export Development Canada (EDC) sees strong opportunities in many sectors, including:&lt;ul class=&quot;country-info-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;cleantech and renewables;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mining and metals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;oil and gas;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;infrastructure and transportation; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICT sectors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;EDC serves Canadian companies in the U.K. through our local representation in London."

                businessenvironment="The Canadian and U.S economies are intricately linked through trade. In recent years, both countries were trading an average of $1.4 million in bilateral goods and services every minute of every day.&lt;br&gt;Canada and the U.S. remain focused on supporting the economic growth of both countries. Canada is America’s largest customer. Following the ratification of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) could result in an uptick in cross-border investment. Now that the agreement is finalized, cross-border investment opportunities will increase as companies move toward near-shoring supply chains. The upside is accelerated as more companies want to move closer to their home markets to improve supply chain risk management. Currently, Canadian companies operating in the U.S. employ approximately 825,000 Americans. &lt;br&gt;As a result, EDC sees continued growth and export investment opportunities that match Canadian potential to further deepen this already strong trading relationship.&lt;br&gt;Export Development Canada (EDC) serves Canadian companies in the United States through our local representations in Atlanta and Chicago."

Its business environment is strengthened by a stable political environment, robust bank supervision, and participation in the  Mercosur economic block with its neighbors."

Accordingly, there has been a sharp decline in exporter and investor interest in this Andean market. The government has significantly increased its control over the country’s assets over the past decade. The business climate is turbulent, and President Maduro's administration has been openly hostile towards private capital and foreign direct investment. This situation is not expected to change over the short term."

Our exporters will also benefit from Vietnam’s free trade agreements, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which provide market access to the broader Asia-Pacific region. Bureaucracy, corruption, infrastructure gaps and the dominance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) pose challenges, so thorough due diligence is necessary when looking for buyers, partners and representatives. Also, be prepared to take time and resources to develop strong local relationships and appoint a local representative to act as an importer/distributor for direct exports."
